INSTALLATION

1. Download the g-zipped tar archive  shapes_*.*-*.tar.gz

2.  Install the package using

         R CMD INSTALL -l /path/to/LIB shapes_*.*-*.tar.gz

/path/to/LIB should be the library directory where you wish to put the 
package.

If you have root access to your machine then use
 

         R CMD INSTALL shapes_*.*-*.tar.gz
 

and the package will be put into the default R library tree.
 

5. You can then start an R session and load the package using
 

         library(shapes,lib.loc="/path/to/LIB")
 

or
 

  library(shapes)
 

(if you installed the package into the default R library tree)
